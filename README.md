This is a tool to find the best combination of initial sizes for cutting out smaller sheets of material.


Todo
- Add ability to add multiple initial sheet sizes in order to find the best one (cost, wasted material, # of cuts)
- Add packing logic to fit sheets on seperate initial sheets (eg fit 2 one one sheet, 4 on another)
